The `atoi.c` file typically contains the implementation of the atoi function. The atoi function is part of the C standard library and is used to convert a string of characters representing an integer to an actual integer value.

In a shell program, the term "built-in" typically refers to commands that are implemented directly within the shell itself, rather than being external programs. Examples of common built-in commands include `cd`, `exit`, `echo`, and `pwd`. These commands are part of the shell and don't require the execution of an external program.
