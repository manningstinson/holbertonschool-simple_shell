# Exit
In a simple shell context, this function provides a way to gracefully exit the shell. Users can execute the `exit` command, and the shell will terminate with a success status. This is a fundamental feature for user interaction and the overall functionality of the shell.

```c
#include "shell.h"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
```

This section includes the necessary header files, including `"shell.h"`, which likely contains declarations specific to the shell, and standard library headers (`stdio.h` and `stdlib.h`).

```c
/**
 * my_exit - Exit the shell
 * @args: The arguments passed to the command
 *
 * Return: Always returns 0, to indicate success
 */
int my_exit(__attribute__((unused)) char **args)
{
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
    return 0;
}
```

The `my_exit` function is a custom shell command for exiting the shell. It takes an array of strings `args` as its argument, though the `__attribute__((unused))` annotation suggests that the function might not use this parameter. The function uses the `exit` function from the `stdlib.h` library to terminate the shell with a success status (`EXIT_SUCCESS`). The `return 0;` statement is included but may be unnecessary since the `exit` function should immediately terminate the program.
