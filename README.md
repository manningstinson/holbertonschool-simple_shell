Scratchpad for simple shell project

The `atoi.c` file typically contains the implementation of the atoi function. The atoi function is part of the C standard library and is used to convert a string of characters representing an integer to an actual integer value.

In a shell program, the term "built-in" typically refers to commands that are implemented directly within the shell itself, rather than being external programs. Examples of common built-in commands include `cd`, `exit`, `echo`, and `pwd`. These commands are part of the shell and don't require the execution of an external program.

Built-in commands in a shell are commands that are directly recognized and executed by the shell itself, without invoking an external program. The set of built-in commands can vary between different shell implementations. In addition to "cd," "exit," "echo," and "pwd," which you mentioned, here are a few more common built-in commands:

**`alias`:** Allows users to create aliases for commands, as discussed earlier.
**`export`:** Sets environment variables or displays a list of environment variables.
**`unset`:** Removes environment variables.
**`set`:** Displays shell variables and their values.
**`unset`:** Removes a shell variable.
**`source` or `.` (dot):** Executes commands from a file in the current shell session, usually used for shell script execution.
**`history`:** Displays or manages the command history list.
**`jobs`:** Displays the status of jobs running in the background.
**`bg` and `fg`:** Controls background and foreground jobs.
**`kill`:** Sends signals to processes, commonly used to terminate or interrupt a process.
**`umask`:** Sets or displays the file mode creation mask.
**`type`:** Indicates how a command name is interpreted (as a built-in, function, alias, or external command).

Keep in mind that the availability of built-in commands depends on the specific shell you are using (e.g., Bash, Zsh, Fish) and its version. You can usually find information about built-in commands in the shell's documentation or by using the `help` command followed by the built-in command name.
