# Built Ins

Built-in commands in a shell are commands that are directly recognized and executed by the shell itself, without invoking an external program. The set of built-in commands can vary between different shell implementations. In addition to "cd," "exit," "echo," and "pwd," which you mentioned, here are a few more common built-in commands:

**`alias`:** Allows users to create aliases for commands, as discussed earlier. <br> <br>
**`export`:** Sets environment variables or displays a list of environment variables.<br><br>
**`unset`:** Removes environment variables.<br><br>
**`set`:** Displays shell variables and their values.<br><br>
**`unset`:** Removes a shell variable.<br><br>
**`source` or `.` (dot):** Executes commands from a file in the current shell session, usually used for shell script execution.<br><br>
**`history`:** Displays or manages the command history list.<br><br>
**`jobs`:** Displays the status of jobs running in the background.<br><br>
**`bg` and `fg`:** Controls background and foreground jobs.<br><br>
**`kill`:** Sends signals to processes, commonly used to terminate or interrupt a process.<br><br>
**`umask`:** Sets or displays the file mode creation mask.<br><br>
**`type`:** Indicates how a command name is interpreted (as a built-in, function, alias, or external command).<br>

Keep in mind that the availability of built-in commands depends on the specific shell you are using (e.g., Bash, Zsh, Fish) and its version. You can usually find information about built-in commands in the shell's documentation or by using the `help` command followed by the built-in command name.
